Help me with my project.
Here's the README.md file of the project:
# Slashdot Social Network Analysis
This project aims to perform Social Network Analysis (SNA) on the Slashdot dataset to understand the relationships and interactions between users within the Slashdot community. The dataset consists of friend and foe relationships between the users of Slashdot, gathered in February 2009.


## Dataset Information

[Slashdot Zoo social network February 2009 Dataset Link](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Slashdot0902.html)

[Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/) is a technology-related news website know for its specific user community. The website features user-submitted and editor-evaluated current primarily technology oriented news. In 2002 Slashdot introduced the Slashdot Zoo feature which allows users to tag each other as friends or foes. The network cotains friend/foe links between the users of Slashdot. The network was obtained in February 2009.

## Stages of the Project

Data Preparation: In this stage, we will preprocess the dataset, clean it, and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. This may involve removing duplicates, handling missing data, and formatting the dataset into a network graph.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA will be performed to obtain a better understanding of the dataset, including node and edge distributions, degree distributions, and other relevant statistics.

Community Detection: We will identify and analyze communities within the Slashdot network. This may involve using clustering algorithms or modularity-based approaches to group users with similar interests or relationships.

Centrality Measures: We will compute and analyze various centrality measures such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality to identify influential users within the network.

Visualization: We will create visualizations to better understand the network structure, including node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices, and heatmaps.

## Potential Outcomes

Understanding the community structure and dynamics

Visual representations of the network structure, communities and other findings

Identification of influential users within the Slashdot community

Prediction of potential new relationships between users

Note: Due to compute limitations, I will just be importing 30% of the dataset.

This is how I currently import the datafile:
file_path = "soc-Slashdot0902.txt"
data = pd.read_csv(file_path, sep="\t", skiprows=4, names=["FromNodeId", "ToNodeId"])

How do I just import just 30% of the data file?
I'm not able to generate a lot of the analysis due to compute constraints.
I hope you have enough context about the dataset.

# Slashdot Social Network Analysis
This project aims to perform Social Network Analysis (SNA) on the Slashdot dataset to understand the relationships and interactions between users within the Slashdot community. The dataset consists of friend and foe relationships between the users of Slashdot, gathered in February 2009.


##Dataset Information
Source: Slashdot Zoo social network from February 2009
Nodes: 82,168
Edges: 948,464


##Stages of the Project
Data Preparation: In this stage, we will preprocess the dataset, clean it, and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. This may involve removing duplicates, handling missing data, and formatting the dataset into a network graph.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA will be performed to obtain a better understanding of the dataset, including node and edge distributions, degree distributions, and other relevant statistics.

Community Detection: We will identify and analyze communities within the Slashdot network. This may involve using clustering algorithms or modularity-based approaches to group users with similar interests or relationships.

Centrality Measures: We will compute and analyze various centrality measures such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality to identify influential users within the network.

Link Prediction: We will apply link prediction techniques to predict potential new relationships between users based on their current network structure. This can help identify users who are likely to become friends or foes in the future.

Sentiment Analysis: By analyzing the content of user posts or comments, we can determine the sentiment behind their interactions and further understand the dynamics within the community.

Visualization: We will create visualizations to better understand the network structure, including node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices, and heatmaps.

Recommendation System: Based on the insights from the analysis, we can develop a recommendation system to suggest new friends or content to users based on their interests and network connections.

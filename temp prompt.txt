I've commented out the following lines due to compute constraints:
betweenness_centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)
closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(G)
nx.set_node_attributes(G, betweenness_centrality, "betweenness_centrality")
nx.set_node_attributes(G, closeness_centrality, "closeness_centrality")

I want to know what kind of impact it may have on our subsequent analysis.
